## Objective

1. To understand the conceptual and practical differences between Virtual Machines and Containers.  
2. To install and configure a Virtual Machine using VirtualBox and Vagrant on Windows.  
3. To install and configure Containers using Docker inside WSL.  
4. To deploy an Ubuntu-based Nginx web server in both environments.  
5. To compare resource utilization, performance, and operational characteristics of Virtual Machines and Containers.

## Experiment 1 (Part B):  
### Containers using WSL (Windows)

### Install Docker Engine inside WSL
**(Image here)**

---

### Run Ubuntu Container with Nginx
**(Image here)**

---

### Verify Nginx in Container
**(Image here)**

---

### Container Observation Commands

## Result

The experiment demonstrates that containers are significantly more lightweight and resource-efficient compared to virtual machines, while virtual machines provide stronger isolation and full OS-level abstraction.

## Conclusion

Virtual Machines are suitable for full OS isolation and legacy workloads, whereas Containers are ideal for microservices, rapid deployment, and efficient resource utilization.
